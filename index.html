            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p style="text-align: left;"> Welcome to my homepage! I'm a 1st year graduate student at NUS. Currently, my primary research interest lies in the <span class="blue-text"> mathematical understanding and algorithm designs</span> for <span class="blue-text">sampling and generative models</span>, with an emphasize on score-based generative models. </p>
            <br>
            <p style="text-align: left;">I am also broadly intrigued by the following topics:</p>
                <ul class="custom-list-circle" style="text-align: left; font-size: 22px;">
                    <li>Connections between sampling and physics (e.g. field theory)</li>
                    <li>Machine learning in general</li>
                    <li>Bayesian statistics</li>
                    <li>Application of ML and sampling to physical sciences and scientific computing (weather, neuroscience, PDE etc.)</li>
                    <li>Large language models</li>
                    <li>Quantum computing</li>
                </ul>            
            <br>
            <p style="text-align: left;"> My programming skills include C++, Python, Julia and LATEX. </p>
            <br>
            <p style="text-align: left;"> Feel free to reach out if you'd like to discuss any of these topics! You can call me <span class="blue-text">Yang</span>, which sounds like "young" in English.

                    <span class="bio-comment">I had the privilege of being part of an elite training program in applied mathematics and statistics. I was very fortunate to be advised by Prof. Daniel Zhengyu Huang and Prof. Bin Dong, who taught me many invaluable lessons on research as well as ways of thinking.
                    I also picked up programming for personal interest, including how to write and run C++ CUDA programs on a HPC cluster. If you are at NUS and face some technical problems like environment setup, I would be happy to assist.</span>
