            <p style="text-align: left;">
                I enjoy exploring a variety of video games in my spare time, organized into three main categories, though they sometimes overlap: <br>
                <br>
                <span class="blue-text">Souls Series</span> (e.g., <em>Dark Souls, Elden Ring, Sekiro</em>): I'm drawn to their atmospheric worlds, intricate and dark lore, and the rewarding challenge of learning from failure. <br>
                <br>
                <span class="blue-text">Games with Complex 3D Maps and Innovative Mechanics</span> (e.g., <em>Outer Wilds, Control, Portal 2</em>): I find joy in exploring their intricate environments and experimenting with creative gameplay mechanics. <br>
                <br>
                <span class="blue-text">Space and Sci-Fi Games</span> (e.g., <em>Deliver Us The Moon, Elite Dangerous, Mass Effect</em>): These games offer a chance to experience today what scientists and engineers are diligently working on to realize tomorrow.
